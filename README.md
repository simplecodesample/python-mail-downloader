# Python Mail Downloader

A script to download emails from your Gmail/ Outlook or any other email account.
Currently this only display a list of all the emails in your inbox folder.

# Usage

Edit the script and update the EMAIL, PASSWORD and mail_server variables and execute the script.
(Keep in mind that it's not secure to just keep your email address and password saved to an unencrypted file. New feature will be added to mitigate this.)


# Errors
Make sure that you have enabled imap for your email account.
